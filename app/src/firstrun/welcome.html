	<p>Your new app is almost ready to use, but due to Chrome&rsquo;s security you need to manually enable the Epichrome Helper extension if you want link redirection and the other features it adds.</p>
	<p>The simplest way is to click this link for the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/epichrome-helper/ngbmbabjgimgbfobhfhjpfhpmpnhbeea" target="_blank">Epichrome Helper</a> page at the Chrome Web Store. You should then see an "Enable this item" link at the top of the page:</p>
	<img src="enable.png" width="100%" />
	<p>If for some reason the extension isn't already installed, you can click the "Add to Chrome" button to install it yourself:</p>
        <img src="addtochrome.png" width="100%" />
	<p>Then restart this app and you'll be off and running! If you have any issues, please report them <a href="https://github.com/dmarmor/epichrome/issues" target="_blank">here</a>. Enjoy!</p>
